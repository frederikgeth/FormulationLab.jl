# Topology simplification transforms on BMOPF network dicts.
#
# All public functions return a deep-copied modified network. Outcomes are
# recorded in `net["_simplification_log"]` as plain Dicts so callers can
# inspect, filter, or serialise them without additional types.
#
# Log entry schema:
#   "operation"    — which function produced this entry
#   "code"         — machine-readable event type (see catalogue below)
#   "severity"     — "info" | "warning"
#   "element_type" — "line" | "bus" | "switch"
#   "element_id"   — the specific element id (or nothing)
#   "message"      — human-readable description
#   "detail"       — optional Dict with structured extras
#
# Event code catalogue:
#   SERIES_MERGE_APPROXIMATE  warning merge_series_lines     inexact merge with structured risk evidence
#   LINES_MERGED              info    merge_series_lines     two lines fused
#   LINECODE_MISMATCH         info    merge_series_lines     adjacent linecodes differ — not merged
#   TERMINAL_MISMATCH         warning merge_series_lines     terminal maps at shared bus differ — not merged
#   SWITCH_IN_CHAIN           warning merge_series_lines     switch blocks a same-linecode chain (likely user error)
#   NON_LINE_ON_BUS           info    merge_series_lines     load/shunt/etc. blocks merge at intermediate bus
#   GROUNDED_BUS              warning merge_series_lines /    bus has grounded terminals — merge/prune would drop the ground

#   PARALLEL_LINES            info    merge_series_lines     two lines form a parallel pair (A—B—A), not a series chain
#   LINE_REMOVED              info    remove_dangling_lines  stub line and leaf bus removed
#   SHUNT_DROPPED             warning remove_dangling_lines  pruned stub carried shunt-to-earth — feasible set may change
#   SWITCH_REMOVED            info    remove_open_switches   open switch element deleted
